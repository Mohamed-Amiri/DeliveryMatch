## 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Entities**
1. **Trip Entity** (`Trip.java`)
   - Driver relationship
   - Location details (departure, destination, intermediate stops)
   - Capacity constraints (dimensions, weight, available capacity)
   - Cargo type preferences
   - Pricing and status
   - Timestamps

2. **ShipmentRequest Entity** (`ShipmentRequest.java`)
   - Shipper and trip relationships
   - Pickup and delivery details
   - Package specifications (dimensions, weight, type)
   - Pricing and status
   - Rejection reasons

### **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**
1. **CreateTripRequest**: For creating new trips
2. **TripResponse**: For trip data responses
3. **ShipmentRequestResponse**: For shipment request data
4. **UpdateShipmentRequestStatusRequest**: For accepting/rejecting requests

### **Service Layer**
1. **TripService**: Handles all trip-related business logic
2. **ShipmentRequestService**: Handles shipment request management

### **Repository Layer**
1. **TripRepository**: Database operations for trips
2. **ShipmentRequestRepository**: Database operations for shipment requests

### **Controller Layer**
- **DriverController**: REST endpoints for all driver functionality

## 🔐 **Security & Authorization**
- ✅ JWT-based authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Drivers can only access their own trips and requests
- ✅ Proper authorization checks enforced
- ✅ Role-based access control (DRIVER role)

## 📊 **API Endpoints Summary**

### **Trip Management**
- `POST /api/driver/trips` - Create trip announcement
- `GET /api/driver/trips` - Get driver trips (paginated)
- `GET /api/driver/trips/active` - Get active trips
- `GET /api/driver/trips/completed` - Get completed trips
- `GET /api/driver/trips/{id}` - Get specific trip
- `PUT /api/driver/trips/{id}/status` - Update trip status
- `DELETE /api/driver/trips/{id}` - Delete trip

### **Shipment Request Management**
- `GET /api/driver/requests` - Get pending requests
- `GET /api/driver/requests/accepted` - Get accepted requests
- `GET /api/driver/requests/completed` - Get completed requests
- `GET /api/driver/trips/{id}/requests` - Get requests for specific trip
- `GET /api/driver/requests/{id}` - Get specific request
- `PUT /api/driver/requests/{id}/status` - Accept/reject request

## 🧪 **Testing Resources**
- ✅ **Postman Collection**: `Driver_API_Tests.postman_collection.json`
- ✅ **Quick Test Script**: `test-driver-api.bat`
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: `DRIVER_API_DOCUMENTATION.md`

## 📋 **Business Rules Implemented**

### **Trip Management**
1. Only trip drivers can update/delete their trips
2. Trips cannot be deleted if they have accepted requests
3. Trip status tracking for progress monitoring
4. Real-time capacity tracking

### **Shipment Requests**
1. Only trip drivers can accept/reject requests
2. Rejection requires a reason
3. Status changes are timestamped
4. Drivers can view all requests for their trips

### **Data Validation**
1. Required fields validation
2. Business logic validation
3. Authorization checks
4. Error handling with detailed messages

## 🚀 **Ready for Use**

The driver functionality is **fully implemented and ready for testing**:

1. **Backend is complete** with all required endpoints
2. **Database schema** is properly designed
3. **Security** is implemented with JWT authentication
4. **Documentation** is comprehensive
5. **Testing tools** are provided

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

To use the driver functionality:

1. **Start the backend** (if not already running)
2. **Import the Postman collection** for testing
3. **Register a driver account** using the auth endpoints
4. **Login to get JWT token**
5. **Test all driver endpoints** using the provided collection

## 📞 **Support**

All driver functionality is implemented according to the requirements:
- ✅ Publish trip announcements with all required details
- ✅ View and manage shipment requests
- ✅ Accept/reject requests based on preferences
- ✅ Track trip and shipment history

The implementation is production-ready and follows Spring Boot best practices with proper error handling, validation, and security measures.
