# üöõ Driver API Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the complete Driver (Conducteur) functionality for the DeliveryMatch platform. Drivers can publish trip announcements, manage shipment requests, and track their delivery history.

## üîê Authentication
All driver endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

## üìä Data Models

### Trip Status
- `ACTIVE`: Trip is available for requests
- `IN_PROGRESS`: Trip has started
- `COMPLETED`: Trip finished
- `CANCELLED`: Trip cancelled

### Request Status
- `PENDING`: Waiting for driver response
- `ACCEPTED`: Driver accepted the request
- `REJECTED`: Driver rejected the request
- `CANCELLED`: Shipper cancelled the request
- `COMPLETED`: Shipment completed

## üîß Business Rules

### Trip Management
1. Only the trip driver can update or delete their trips
2. Trips cannot be deleted if they have accepted shipment requests
3. Trip status can be updated to track progress
4. Available capacity is tracked in real-time

### Shipment Requests
1. Only the trip driver can accept/reject requests for their trips
2. Rejection requires a reason
3. Request status changes are tracked with timestamps
4. Drivers can view all requests for their trips

### Security
1. All endpoints require JWT authentication
2. Drivers can only access their own trips and requests
3. Proper authorization checks are enforced

## üß™ Testing

Use the provided Postman collection `Driver_API_Tests.postman_collection.json` to test all endpoints.

### Test Flow:
1. Register a driver account
2. Login to get JWT token
3. Create a trip announcement
4. View trip details and requests
5. Accept/reject shipment requests
6. Update trip status
7. View trip history

## üìù Error Handling

The API returns appropriate HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `201`: Created
- `400`: Bad Request
- `401`: Unauthorized
- `403`: Forbidden
- `404`: Not Found
- `500`: Internal Server Error

Error responses include detailed messages:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:00:00",
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Rejection reason is required when rejecting a request"
}
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Ensure the backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`
2. Import the Postman collection
3. Set the `baseUrl` variable to `http://localhost:8080`
4. Register a driver account
5. Login and copy the JWT token to the `driverToken` variable
6. Start testing the endpoints!
